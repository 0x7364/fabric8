These scripts are now filtered as part of the build of the fabric-distro project.  To build the
scripts cd into "fabric-distro" and run "mvn clean install".  Then you can either source the
script directly via :

shell:source (your fabric source)/fabric-distro/target/classes/script.karaf

or better still just do it via maven, for example:

shell:source mvn:org.fusesource.fabric/fabric-distro/${project.version}/karaf/activemq
