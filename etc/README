Introduction
=======

These scripts are now filtered as part of the build of the fabric-distro project.  To build the
scripts cd into "fabric-distro" and run "mvn clean install".  Then you can either source the
script directly via :

shell:source (your fabric source)/fabric-distro/target/classes/script.karaf

or better still just do it via maven, for example:

shell:source mvn:org.fusesource.fabric/fabric-distro/${project.version}/karaf/activemq


Running an ActiveMQ Broker
=================

Make sure you have

    http://repo.fusesource.com/nexus/content/groups/public/

added to org.ops4j.pax.url.mvn.repositories property in etc/org.ops4j.pax.url.mvn.cfg file.

Start Karaf

To create a profile with default configuration, run:

    shell:source mvn:org.fusesource.fabric/fabric-distro/1.1-SNAPSHOT/karaf/activemq-installer

Next you can create, agents with this profile like:

    fabric:create-agent --profile activemq --parent root broker

Wait for a few seconds for the agent to start. Check the status of the agent with:

    fabric:list-agents

You can (optionally) connect to the agent, with

    fabric:connect broker

If you want to start a demo that produces/consumes messages using 'fabric' transport run

    features:addurl mvn:org.fusesource.fabric.fabric-examples/fabric-activemq-demo/1.1-SNAPSHOT/xml/features
    features:install fabric-activemq-demo
