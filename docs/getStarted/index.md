## Getting Started

#### OpenShift / Kubernetes setup

First you need an OpenShift/Kubernetes environment, which can be setup in multiple ways. For a quick start choose one 
of these two recipes:

* [**Vagrant**](vagrant.html)
  
  This is the easiest and fastest way to get started with fabric8 locally. 
  All you need is [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) installed locally. 
  The detailed steps are described in "[Fabric8 Vagrant Image](vagrant.html)"

* [**Native OpenShift**](openshift.html) 
  
  If you have [OpenShift V3](http://www.openshift.com) installed locally, 
  this [guide](openshift.html) helps you step-by-step how to install fabric8 on it.

#### Local client setup

For a smooth developer experience and for using the fabric8 [tools](../tools.html) a local OpenShift client needs to be setup.
How this is done is described in this [recipe](local.html).

### What's next

* [Run a fabric8 App](apps.html)
* [Check out the Quickstarts](../quickstarts.html)
* [Learn how to develop applications locally](develop.html)
* [Running a quickstart on the iPaaS](example.html)

### Troubleshooting

Hopefully that will get you started quickly; if you hit any issues check out the [FAQ](http://fabric8.io/guide/FAQ.html), [get in touch](http://fabric8.io/community/index.html) or [raise an issue](https://github.com/fabric8io/fabric8/issues)
