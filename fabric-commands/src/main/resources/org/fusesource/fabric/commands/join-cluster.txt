This command should be used to join this instance to the existing fabric cluster.

By specifying zookeeper URL, this karaf instance will be registered as a root agent, in the existing zookeeper instance

 e.g. fabric:join-cluster myhost:2181

 Note that root agents should have different names (karaf name) or they'll override each other data.

 You can change the name, by changing karaf.name property in ${KARAF_HOME}/etc/system.properties
