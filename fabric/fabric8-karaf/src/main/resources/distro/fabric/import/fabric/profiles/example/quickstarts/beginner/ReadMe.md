## Beginner QuickStarts

This folder containers various beginner quickstart examples to help you get started with the various aspects of Fabric

First time users of Fabric is recommended to try the [camel.log](/fabric/profiles/example/quickstarts/beginner/camel.log.profile) profile, which is a very simple Camel application that writes to the server log every 5th second.

Then try either the [camel.cbr](/fabric/profiles/example/quickstarts/beginner/camel.cbr.profile) or the [camel.cbr.wiki](/fabric/profiles/example/quickstarts/beginner/camel.cbr.wiki.profile) quickstart. They are both based on the same example using a Content Based Router using Apache Camel.

To learn more about other Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIP) supported by Apache Camel, then try the [camel.eips](/fabric/profiles/example/quickstarts/beginner/camel.eips.profile)  quickstart.

The [camel.errorhandler](/fabric/profiles/example/quickstarts/beginner/camel.errorhandler.profile) quickstart introduces how you can handle errors with Apace Camel.
