    <h1>Fuse Profiles</h1>
<p>This page lists all of the configuration profiles available to containers in the fabric.</p>

<p>The configuration profiles consist of data about what bundles are deployed into a container and configuration data for those bundles.</p>

<p>Profiles are organized by versions. Each version can consist of instances of the same profiles with changes or can have a collection of different profiles.</p>

<p>The page is broken down into three sections:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Controls</strong> - buttons that allow you to edit the versions and profiles</li>
<li><strong>Versions</strong> - lists all of the versions available to the fabric</li>
<li><strong>Profiles</strong> - lists all of the configuration profiles available to the container in the fabric</li>
</ul>
<h2>Controls</h2>
<p>The controls are located across the top of the page. They consist of five buttons:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Create Version</strong> - Creates a new version of the existing profiles</li>
<li><strong>Delete Versions</strong> - Deletes one or more versions</li>
</ul><blockquote><p><strong>Important</strong> Versions that are in use by one or more container cannot be deleted.</p>
</blockquote><ul><li><strong>Change Default Version</strong> - Changes the profile version used as the default when creating new containers</li>
<li><strong>Create Profile</strong> - Creates a new profile in the currently selected version</li>
</ul><blockquote><p><strong>Important</strong> The new profile will only exist in the current profile and are not propagated to other version.</p>
</blockquote><ul><li><strong>Delete Profiles</strong> - Deletes one, or more, profiles from the current version</li>
</ul><blockquote><p><strong>Important</strong> Profiles deleted from one version are still present in all other versions.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Versions</h2>

<li>The number of containers using the version</li>
<li>The default version used to create new containers</li>
</ul>
<h2>Profiles</h2>
