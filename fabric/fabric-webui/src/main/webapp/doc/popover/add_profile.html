    <h1>Add Profiles to Container</h1>

<p>Assigns the selected profiles to a container.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Note</strong> - Profiles can be deleted from a container on the <strong>Fuse Container Instance</strong> page or the <strong>Container Details</strong> page. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>A container's profiles are all part of the same version. So, all of the profiles listed in the wizard are from the container's profile version.</p>

<p>To add a profile to a container:</p>
<ol><li>Select one or more profiles from the list.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Add</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote><p><strong>Tip</strong> - If a profile is already deployed into the container, it will not be in the list.</p></blockquote>
