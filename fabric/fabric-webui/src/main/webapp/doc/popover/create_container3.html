    <h1>Select container type</h1>

<p>The container type defines where the container is deployed. There are three types of containers:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Child container</strong> - a container that is created on the same machine as an existing root container. The child runs in its own VM, but the parent container can stop and start the container.</li>
</ul><blockquote><p><strong>Important</strong>: Child containers cannot be parent containers.</p>
<p><strong>Tip</strong>: Child containers should not be used for Fabric registry agents.</p>
</blockquote><ul><li><strong>Remote root container</strong> - a container that is created independent of other containers. Root containers can be parents of child containers.</li>
<li><strong>Cloud-managed Fuse container</strong> - a root container that is deployed on a host obtained from a cloud provider. Fuse Fabric works with most popular cloud providers including Amazon and RackSpace.</li>
</ul><blockquote><p><strong>Note</strong>: You can use an internal cloud provider</p></blockquote>
