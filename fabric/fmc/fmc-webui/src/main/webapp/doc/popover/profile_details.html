    <h1>Profile Details</h1>

<p>Displays all of the details about a profile and lets you edit them.</p>

<p>The top of the page shows the basic information about the profile:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Version</strong> - the profile version to which the displayed profile belongs</li>
<li><strong>Parent Profiles</strong> - the profiles from which the displayed profile inherits settings</li>
</ul>
<p>The rest of the page is used to display the contents of the profile. It is broken into four tabs:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Features</strong> - the features, defined as Apache Karaf feature files, that are loaded into the container</li>
<li><strong>Bundles</strong> - the OSGi bundles and Fuse Application Bundles that are installed into the container</li>
<li><strong>Repositories</strong> - the Apache Maven repositories from which artifacts can be downloaded</li>
<li><strong>Config Files</strong> - the configuration files used to specify runtime behaviors for the container and the services deployed into the container</li>
</ul>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>A feature is a collection of bundles, configuration, and other artifacts that can be installed as a single entity. They are specified using an XML file and are typically stored in a Maven repository.</p>
<p>A feature is specified by an ID and a version using the syntax:</p>
<pre><code>id-string/version</code>
</pre><p>To add a new feature:</p>
<ol><li>Enter the ID and version into the <strong>Add new feature</strong> field</li>
<li>Click <strong>Add</strong>.</li>
</ol><p>To delete a feature from the profile click the <strong>X</strong> to the left of the feature's name.</p>

<h2>Bundles</h2>
<p>Bundles are a library of artifacts that are deployed into a container. There are two types of bundles that can be added to a container:</p>
<ul><li>OSGi bundle - a JAR file containing a standard OSGi manifest file</li>
<li>Fuse Application Bundle - a JAR file containing a modified Maven POM file that outlines the JARs dependencies</li>
</ul>
<p>To add a new bundle:</p>
<ol><li>Enter the ID and version into the <strong>Add new bundle</strong> field.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Add</strong>.</li>
</ol><p>To delete a bundle from the profile click the <strong>X</strong> to the left of the bundle's name.</p>

<h2>Repositories</h2>
<p>To add a new repository:</p>
<ol><li>Enter the repository's URL into the <strong>Add new repository</strong> field.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Add</strong>.</li>
</ol><p>To delete a repository from the profile click the <strong>X</strong> to the left of the repository's URL.</p>

<h2>Config Files</h2>
<p>Config files are text files that configure some portion of the container's runtime or one of the services deployed into the container.</p>

<p>To add a new configuration file:</p>
<ol><li>Enter the ID and version into the <strong>Add new config file</strong> field.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Add</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote><p><strong>Important</strong> - If the config file is not named properly the container may not load it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To edit a configuration file:</p>
<ol><li>Click on its name</li>
<li>Edit the text in the pop-up window.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote><p><strong>Important</strong> - The console does not validate the configuration file.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To delete a configuration file from the profile click the <strong>X</strong> to the left of the config file's name.</p>
