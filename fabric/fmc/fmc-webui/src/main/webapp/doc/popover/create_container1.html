    <h1>Set container's basic information</h1>

<p>Every container in a fabric requires a name. In addition there are some general options you can specify for all container types.</p>

<h2>Name</h2>
<p>Specifies the name for the new container. The name must be unique within the fabric. It <strong>must</strong> not include: spaces, asterisks (*), commas (,), dollar signs ($), colons (:), semi-colons (;), percent signs (%), back slashes (\), or other special characters.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Important</strong>: This field in mandatory.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Options</h2>
<h3>Make container a distributed registry server</h3>
<p>Selecting this option will make this container a fabric registry agent. It will be one of the containers responsible for maintaining the fabric's registry data.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Tip</strong>: Fabric registry agents should not host any application services.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Enable remote debugging</h3>
<p>Selecting this option makes the container emit JMX statistics.</p>

<h2>Maven Proxy URL</h2>
<p>Setting this option will direct the container to use the provided Maven proxy for downloading any required artifacts.</p>

<h2>Count</h2>
<p>Specifies how many clones of the container to create. The clones will append an instance number to the value specified in the <strong>Name</strong> field. For example, if the specified name was esb, the resulting containers will be named esb1, esb2, esb3, etc..</p>
