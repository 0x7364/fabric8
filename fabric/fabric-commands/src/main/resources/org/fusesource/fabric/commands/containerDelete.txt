Deleting a container deletes all of the files associated with the container from the host.

If the container has children, the default behavior of the command is to leave the children in place. You can force the deletion of the children using the -r option.

Note: If the container to be deleted is running a fabric registry agent, you must first remove it from the ensemble using fabric:ensemble-remove.
