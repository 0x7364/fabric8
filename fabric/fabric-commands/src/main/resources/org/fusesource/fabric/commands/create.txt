This command is used to create a new fabric (similar to the fabric:ensemble-create command). Either fabric:create or fabric:ensemble-create can be used to create a new fabric, but fabric:create has the additional ability to import fabric profiles.

Here are some examples of how to use the fabric:create command:

* Create a fabric and import sample profiles from the ESBInstallDir/fabric/import directory, as follows:

fabric:create --clean

* Create a fabric and import profiles from the custom import directory, CustomImportDir, as follows:

fabric:create --clean --import-dir CustomImportDir
