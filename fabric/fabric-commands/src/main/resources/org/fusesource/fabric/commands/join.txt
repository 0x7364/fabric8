This command should be used to join this container to an existing Fabric cluster.

By specifying zookeeper URL, this container will be registered as a root container, in the existing zookeeper instance

 e.g. fabric:join myhost:2181

 Note that root containers should have different names (karaf name) or they'll override each others data.

 You can change the name, by changing karaf.name property in ${KARAF_HOME}/etc/system.properties
