      Fuse stores its source code in a [Git](http://git-scm.com/) repository hosted on [github](http://github.com) at this location:

      * [#{github_page}](#{github_page})

      If you are new to Git you might like to try the [Git guide for subversion users](http://git.or.cz/course/svn.html) or have a look at the [Git community book](http://book.git-scm.com/).

      Read only access to the repository is available at the following URL:

      * **#{git_user_url}**

      You must first install a [Git client](http://git-scm.com/download). Then you clone the repository using the following:

          git clone #{git_user_url}
          cd fuse

      Now you probably want to try [build the fabric code](building.html)
