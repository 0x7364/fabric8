    # Install

  :&markdown
    To install Fabric either
    
    * [download](../download.html) the Fabric distro 
    * [checkout](../source.html) and [build](../building.html) the Fabric distro locally
    * run the following in an Apache Karaf (2.2.x) console:  
    
  pre
    | karaf@root> shell:source mvn:org.fusesource.fabric/fabric-distro/#{project_version}/karaf/installer

  :&markdown
    The above command will install the necessary features if they are not already present (they come by default in the Fabric distro) and then
    create the initial ZooKeeper server and profiles.

    # Create a new agent with an existing profile
.right
  pre
    | karaf@root> fabric:create-agent --profile activemq --parent root broker1
    | ...
  :&markdown
    Check that the agent has been created (it can take a few seconds):  
  pre
    | karaf@root> fabric:list-agents
    | [id]                           [alive]    [profiles]
    | root                           true       default, zk-server-0000-1
    | broker1                        true       activemq
    
  :&markdown
    Wait a few seconds, then check that the feature has been deployed:  
  pre
    | karaf@root> fabric:connect broker1
    | ...
    | karaf@test> osgi:list
    | ...

    Now, let's create a profile webserver, inheriting the default profile:  
  pre
    | karaf@root> fabric:create-profile --parents default webserver

.left
  :markdown
    # Create a new agent with this profile
.right
  pre
    | karaf@root> fabric:create-agent --profile webserver --parent root test
    | ...
  :&markdown
    Check that the agent has been created (it can take a few seconds):  
  pre
    | karaf@root> fabric:list-agents
    | [id]                           [alive]    [profiles]
    | root                           true       default, zk-server-0000-1
    | test                           true       webserver

.left
  :markdown
    # Deploy a feature using profiles
.right
  :&markdown
    Let's associate a karaf war feature to the webserver profile:  
  pre
    | karaf@root> zk:create -r /fabric/configs/versions/base/profiles/webserver/org.fusesource.fabric.agent/repository.karaf mvn:org.apache.karaf.assemblies.features/standard/2.2.1/xml/features
    | karaf@root> zk:create -r /fabric/configs/versions/base/profiles/webserver/org.fusesource.fabric.agent/feature.war war
  :&markdown
    Wait a few seconds, then check that the feature has been deployed:  
  pre
    | karaf@root> fabric:connect test
    | ...
    | karaf@test> osgi:list
    | ...
